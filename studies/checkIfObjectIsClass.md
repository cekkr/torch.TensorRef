In Python, to check if an object is a class (as opposed to an instance of a class or any other kind of object), you can use the built-in function `isinstance()` in combination with the `type` type or the `inspect` module's `isclass()` function. Here are both methods:

### Using `isinstance()` and `type`

You can compare the type of the object to `type` itself, because in Python, classes are objects of type `type`.

```python
class MyClass:
    pass

obj = MyClass()

# Check if obj is a class
print(isinstance(MyClass, type))  # True, MyClass is a class
print(isinstance(obj, type))      # False, obj is an instance of MyClass, not a class

# Another example with built-in types
print(isinstance(int, type))      # True, int is a class
```

### Using `inspect.isclass()`

The `inspect` module provides a high-level function specifically for checking if an object is a class.

```python
import inspect

class MyClass:
    pass

obj = MyClass()

# Check if obj is a class
print(inspect.isclass(MyClass))  # True
print(inspect.isclass(obj))      # False

# Another example with built-in types
print(inspect.isclass(int))      # True
```

The `inspect.isclass()` function is more readable and directly communicates the intent of your code, which can make it a preferable choice for clarity.

### Summary

- Use `isinstance(obj, type)` if you prefer not to import additional modules and are comfortable with the fact that classes are instances of `type`.
- Use `inspect.isclass(obj)` for a clearer and more explicit approach to determining if an object is a class.
