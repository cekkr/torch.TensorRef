`nn.PReLU` stands for Parametric Rectified Linear Unit, and it is a layer provided by PyTorch in the `torch.nn` module. It introduces a learnable parameter that allows the layer to adapt during the training process, potentially improving model performance on certain tasks compared to the standard ReLU activation function.

Here's an example of how to use `nn.PReLU` in a simple neural network. This network will consist of a couple of linear layers for a generic task, such as binary classification, and we'll incorporate `nn.PReLU` between these linear layers.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(in_features=10, out_features=20)  # Example input features: 10, output features: 20
        self.prelu = nn.PReLU()  # PReLU activation
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(in_features=20, out_features=1)  # Output layer for binary classification

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear1(x)
        x = self.prelu(x)  # Applying PReLU activation
        x = self.linear2(x)
        return torch.sigmoid(x)  # Applying sigmoid activation for binary classification

# Create a model instance
model = SimpleNN()

# Example input tensor
input_tensor = torch.randn(5, 10)  # Batch size of 5, feature size of 10

# Forward pass through the model
output = model(input_tensor)

print(output)  # Print the output of the model
```

In this example:

1. **`SimpleNN` class definition**: We define a simple neural network with two linear layers. The `nn.PReLU` layer is placed between these two linear layers.

2. **`__init__` method**: This method initializes the layers. `self.linear1` defines the first linear layer with 10 input features and 20 output features. `self.prelu` initializes the PReLU activation function. `self.linear2` defines the second linear layer, intended to produce a single output feature for binary classification.

3. **`forward` method**: This method defines the forward pass of the network. The input tensor `x` is passed through `self.linear1`, then through the `self.prelu` activation function, and finally through `self.linear2`. The `torch.sigmoid` function is applied to the output of `self.linear2` to get a binary classification result.

4. **Model instantiation and example usage**: We create an instance of `SimpleNN` and pass an example input tensor with a batch size of 5 and 10 features. The output is the model's prediction for this batch.

This demonstrates a basic use of `nn.PReLU` within a PyTorch model, showcasing how it can be integrated into a network architecture to potentially improve learning dynamics.
