Cycling through the methods of a Python class can be accomplished by using reflection capabilities provided by the Python standard library, specifically through the `inspect` module. This allows you to introspect the properties of objects at runtime, including listing the methods of a class.

Here's an example of how to cycle through the methods of a Python class, including inherited methods, but excluding magic methods (those surrounded by double underscores, like `__init__`):

```python
import inspect

class MyBaseClass:
    def base_method(self):
        pass

class MyClass(MyBaseClass):
    def my_method(self):
        pass

    def another_method(self):
        pass

# Inspect MyClass to find methods
methods = [member for member in dir(MyClass) if callable(getattr(MyClass, member)) and not member.startswith("__")]

print("Methods of MyClass:")
for method in methods:
    print(method)

# If you want to include methods from base classes as well, use inspect.getmembers() with a filter
all_methods = inspect.getmembers(MyClass, predicate=inspect.isfunction)

print("\nAll methods of MyClass (including base classes):")
for method_name, method in all_methods:
    print(method_name)
```

In this code:

- `dir(MyClass)` is used to get a list of all attributes of `MyClass`. This includes methods, as well as any fields and special methods like `__init__`.
- `callable(getattr(MyClass, member))` checks if the attribute is callable, which is true for methods.
- `not member.startswith("__")` is used to exclude magic methods, which are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores.
- `inspect.getmembers(MyClass, predicate=inspect.isfunction)` is used to get all function members of the class, including inherited methods. The `predicate=inspect.isfunction` filter ensures that only methods are included, not other callable objects.

This approach allows you to dynamically inspect and list the methods of a class, which can be useful for debugging, introspection, and meta-programming tasks.
