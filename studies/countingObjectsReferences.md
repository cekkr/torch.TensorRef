Yes, in Python, you can determine how many references are active for a particular object using the `sys.getrefcount()` function provided by the `sys` module. This function returns the reference count of the object passed to it. It's important to note that `getrefcount()` includes the reference from the argument passed to the function itself in its count, so the number it returns will be one higher than you might expect.

Here's a basic example:

```python
import sys

a = []
b = a  # b references the same list as a
c = a  # c also references the same list as a

# This will return 4 because: one reference from `a`, one from `b`, one from `c`,
# and one temporary reference created by passing the object to `getrefcount()`.
print(sys.getrefcount(a))
```

### Caution

While `getrefcount()` can be useful for debugging or understanding the reference count of an object, it's generally not something you'll need to use in typical application code. Python's garbage collector is designed to handle reference counting and object lifecycle automatically, so manual reference counting is rarely necessary.

Also, be aware that manipulating or relying on specific reference counts can be error-prone and lead to code that is difficult to maintain or that behaves unpredictably, especially with Python's optimizations like small integers and interned strings sharing references across the entire Python process.

Furthermore, because `getrefcount()` includes its own call's temporary reference in the count, interpreting its return value requires understanding this behavior to avoid off-by-one errors in your expectations.
