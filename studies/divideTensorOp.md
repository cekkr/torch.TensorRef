Yes, dividing a softmax operation into multiple chunks is possible, but it requires careful handling to maintain the mathematical correctness of the operation. The softmax function is defined as the exponential of each element divided by the sum of the exponentials of all elements in the input tensor. Because the softmax operation involves a normalization step that depends on all elements of the input tensor, simply applying softmax to chunks independently would not yield the correct result.

However, you can compute the softmax of a large tensor in chunks by separating the computation of the exponentials and the normalization factor (sum of exponentials). The key is to ensure that the normalization factor takes into account all elements of the tensor, even when computed in chunks.

Here’s an approach to compute softmax in chunks:

1. Compute the exponentials of each chunk.
2. Sum all the exponentials to get the normalization factor. This might require computing the exponentials of the entire tensor but in chunked form to avoid memory issues.
3. Divide the exponentials of each chunk by the normalization factor.

This approach allows you to handle tensors that are too large to be processed as a whole, assuming you can still compute the sum of exponentials in a memory-efficient manner.

Here's a conceptual example:

```python
import torch

def softmax_in_chunks(tensor, chunks):
    # Compute exponentials for each chunk and keep track of them
    exp_chunks = [torch.exp(chunk) for chunk in torch.chunk(tensor, chunks)]
    
    # Compute the sum of all exponentials (normalization factor)
    sum_exp = sum(chunk.sum() for chunk in exp_chunks)
    
    # Apply the normalization to each chunk and collect the results
    softmax_chunks = [chunk / sum_exp for chunk in exp_chunks]
    
    # Concatenate the chunks back together
    softmax_result = torch.cat(softmax_chunks)
    
    return softmax_result

# Example usage
large_tensor = torch.randn(1000)  # A large tensor for demonstration
softmax_result = softmax_in_chunks(large_tensor, chunks=10)

# Validate the result by comparing it to PyTorch's built-in softmax
expected_result = torch.softmax(large_tensor, dim=0)
print(torch.allclose(softmax_result, expected_result))
```

This example demonstrates how to apply softmax to a large tensor in chunks. It's crucial to ensure that the sum of exponentials considers all parts of the tensor to maintain the correctness of the softmax computation. The final step checks the custom chunk-based softmax against PyTorch’s built-in softmax to validate the results.
